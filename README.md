# [Amazon-Clone](https://amazon-clone111.netlify.app/)

This project was a collaborative effort that provided us with valuable experience in working on team-based projects. Throughout the development process, we faced many challenges that helped us improve our skills in problem-solving, adapting to a competitive environment, and handling unexpected issues effectively.

We built an Amazon clone using only simple technologies, without relying on any frameworks. Our goal was to make the clone as close as possible to the original Amazon website. The tools and technologies we used are listed below.
